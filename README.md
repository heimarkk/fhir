# FHIR Patient Manager

A JavaScript-based web application for managing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) patient data through a RESTful API interface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) project.**

This application is designed for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for production use in healthcare environments or with real patient data.

## ü§ñ AI-Generated Code Disclaimer

**Most of the code in this project was generated using Artificial Intelligence tools.** While the code has been reviewed and tested for basic functionality, users should thoroughly validate and test all functionality before any use, especially in healthcare-related contexts.

## Features

- **FHIR Server Connectivity**: Connect to FHIR-compliant servers
- **Patient Management**: Create, read, update, and delete patient records
- **Patient Search**: Search for patients by name or ID
- **Data Validation**: Client-side validation for patient data including:
  - Email format validation
  - Phone number format validation
  - Date validation (birth date cannot be in the future)
- **Real-time Logging**: Console and UI logging for operations
- **FHIR Resource Display**: View raw FHIR JSON resources

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Application**

   - Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

2. **Configure FHIR Server**

   - Default server: `https://fhir-bootcamp.medblocks.com/fhir/`
   - You can change the server URL in the application interface

3. **Test Connection**

   - Click "Test Connection" to verify server connectivity

4. **Manage Patients**
   - Create new patients using the form
   - Search for existing patients
   - Update or delete patient records

## FHIR Compliance

This application works with FHIR R4 specification and expects:

- Standard FHIR Patient resources
- JSON format (`application/fhir+json`)
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations

## Browser Requirements

- Modern web browser with ES6+ support
- Fetch API support
- Local storage access for settings

## Development

The main functionality is contained in the `FHIRPatientManager` class in `fhripatient.js`. Key methods include:

- `createPatient()` - Create new patient records
- `searchPatients()` - Search for patients by name
- `getPatientById()` - Retrieve patient by ID
- `loadPatientForUpdate()` - Load patient data for editing
- `deletePatient()` - Remove patient records

## Data Validation

The application includes client-side validation for:

- **Required Fields**: First name, last name, gender, birth date
- **Email Format**: Standard email regex validation
- **Phone Numbers**: International format with length limits
- **Birth Date**: Must be a valid date, cannot be in the future
